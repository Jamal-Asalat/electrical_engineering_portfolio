# Full-Wave Rectifier with Filtering

## Overview
This project involves the design, construction, and testing of a full-wave rectifier circuit with filtering. The objective was to convert an AC input signal into a stable DC output and analyze ripple, voltage regulation, and load behavior.

## Objectives
- Design a full-wave rectifier using discrete diodes
- Implement capacitor-based filtering to reduce ripple
- Measure output voltage and ripple under varying loads
- Compare theoretical calculations with measured results

## Circuit Description
The circuit consists of a full-wave rectifier followed by a smoothing capacitor. The rectifier converts both halves of the AC waveform into a unidirectional output, while the filter capacitor reduces voltage ripple to produce a more stable DC output.

## Tools & Equipment
- Function generator / AC source
- Oscilloscope
- Multimeter
- Discrete diodes
- Capacitors and resistive loads

## Results
Measured output waveforms and voltage levels were compared against theoretical expectations. Filtering significantly reduced ripple voltage, with performance varying based on load conditions.
